# EM_alg_for_MSN

These are two example codes for fitting modified skew-normal (MSN) distribution to simulated observations from the MSN distribution for dimension one and dimension more than one.

The variables fin_xi, fin_Psi, and fin_eta return the final estimates of the respective parameters.

Users can edit the stopping criteria of the EM algorithm in the "while" loop inside the code at their convenience.

For fitting the MSN model to a dataset, replace the matrix X with the data matrix.
